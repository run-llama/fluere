title: Getting Started with Workflows
description: Learn how to use LlamaIndex's lightweight workflow engine for TypeScript
---

Workflows are a simple and lightweight engine for TypeScript. Built with ❤️ by LlamaIndex.

- Minimal core API (\<\=2kb)
- 100% Type safe
- Event-driven, stream oriented programming
- Support for multiple JS runtimes/frameworks

## Installation

It's directly included with the `llamaindex` package:

```shell
npm i llamaindex
```

But can also be installed separately:

```shell
npm i @llama-flow/core

# or with yarn
yarn add @llama-flow/core

# or with pnpm
pnpm add @llama-flow/core
```

## Key Concepts

- **Events**: Data carriers that flow through the workflow
- **Handlers**: Functions that process events and emit new events
- **Workflow**: Connects events and handlers together
- **Context**: Runtime environment for a workflow execution

## Basic Usage

Let's build a simple workflow that processes a text input:

### 1. Define events

First, we need to define the events that will flow through our workflow:

```ts
import { workflowEvent } from "@llama-flow/core";

// Define input and output events
const startEvent = workflowEvent<string>(); // Takes a string input
const convertEvent = workflowEvent<Number>();       // Intermediate event
const stopEvent = workflowEvent<1 | -1>();  // Final output event, returns 1 or -1
```

### 2. Create a workflow and connect events

Next, we'll create our workflow and define how events are processed:

```ts
import { createWorkflow } from "@llama-flow/core";

const workflow = createWorkflow();

// Handle the start event: convert the string to a number
workflow.handle([startEvent], (start) => {
  return convertEvent.with(Number.parseInt(start.data, 10));
});

// Handle the convert event: determine if number is positive or negative
workflow.handle([convertEvent], (convert) => {
  return stopEvent.with(convert.data > 0 ? 1 : -1);
});
```

### 3. Run the workflow

Finally, we can execute our workflow:

```ts
// Create a workflow context and send the initial event
const { stream, sendEvent } = workflow.createContext();
sendEvent(startEvent.with("42"));

// Process the stream to get the result
import { pipeline } from "node:stream/promises";

const result = await pipeline(stream, async function (source) {
  for await (const event of source) {
    if (stopEvent.include(event)) {
      return `Result: ${event.data === 1 ? 'positive' : 'negative'}`;
    }
  }
});

console.log(result); // "Result: positive"
```

Or using the stream utilities:

```ts
import { collect, until } from "@llama-flow/core";

// Collect all events until we get a stopEvent
const allEvents = await collect(until(stream, stopEvent));
const finalEvent = allEvents[allEvents.length - 1];
console.log(`Result: ${finalEvent.data === 1 ? 'positive' : 'negative'}`);
```
