LlamaIndex Workflow (LlamaFlow) is a library for streaming event-driven programming in JavaScript and TypeScript.
It provides a simple and lightweight orchestration solution for building complex workflows with minimal boilerplate.

It combines [event-driven] programming, [directed graphs], and [streaming] to create a flexible and efficient way to handle data processing tasks.

The essential concepts of LlamaFlow are:

- **Events**: are the core building blocks of LlamaFlow. They represent data that flows through the system.
- **Handlers**: are functions that process events and can produce new events.
- **Context**: is the environment in which events are processed. It provides access to the event stream and allows sending new events.
- **Workflow**: is the collection of events, handlers, and context that define the processing logic.

## Getting Started

```shell
npm i @llama-flow/core

yarn add @llama-flow/core

pnpm add @llama-flow/core

bun add @llama-flow/core

deno add npm:@llama-flow/core
```

## First Example

```ts
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { createWorkflow, workflowEvent } from '@llama-flow/core';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const startEvent = workflowEvent<string>();
const stopEvent = workflowEvent<string>();

const workflow = createWorkflow();

workflow.handle([startEvent], async (event) => {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: event.data }],
  });

  return stopEvent(response.choices[0].message.content);
});

workflow.handle([stopEvent], (event) => {
  console.log("Response:", event.data);
});

const { sendEvent, stream } = workflow.createContext()
sendEvent(startEvent.with("Hello, LlamaFlow!"));
```
